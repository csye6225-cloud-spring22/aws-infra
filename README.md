### Implementing the Infrastructure using Terraform

- Clone the repository
- Initialize the Terraform repo using the following command
  - `terraform init`
- In this repo, I've given the default region and default profile as "us-east-1" and "dev", if you want to give other values, make sure you create and initialize the variables inside the *.tfvars* file
- In order to see if there are any syntax errors and observe which services will be added, run the following command
  - `terraform plan`
- Now, in order to implement them to AWS, please run the following command
  - `terraform apply --auto-approve`
  - Adding --auto-approve tag will disable asking for the confirmation prompt
- In order to remove the resources from AWS, please run the following command
  - `terraform destroy --auto-approve`
- It is advisable to create any (file-name).tfvars and initialize the variables inside it. In order to include this tfvar file while applying the resources, please add --var-file="<(file-name)>.tfvars"
  - Eg:
    - `terraform apply --auto-approve -var-file="<file-name>.tfvars"`
    - `terraform destroy --auto-approve -var-file="<file-name>.tfvars"`
